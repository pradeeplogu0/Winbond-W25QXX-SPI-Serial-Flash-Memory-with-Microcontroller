# Winbond W25QXX SPI Serial Flash Memory with Microcontroller

The Winbond Flash Memory provides extended megabits and bytes serial flash, used for storage on chip solution system with limited space, pins and power. The W25Q series provides flexibility and enhance performance beyond ordinary Serial Flash Devices. This device are ideal for code shadowing to RAM, executing code directly from the Dual Quad SPI storing voice, text, and data. This device operates on a single 2.7v ~ 3.6v power supply with current consumption as low as 4mA active & 1uA for power down. For this demonstration we will going to wire the W25Q80BV an 8Mbit serial flash memory which is available in modular type suited for any microcontroller like Arduino, Tenssy, and other popular microcontrollers.
